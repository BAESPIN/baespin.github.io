# 10/31/03

## First a few words

### The day that my heart and soul were born...

I want to wish a very happy birthday to the love of my life.
I hope that today has been a wonderful day for you.

### What gift could I give you that would be enough?

I wish I could explain how happy I am to have seen you grow this past year.
Take a moment with me to relive the memories that we have made together.
